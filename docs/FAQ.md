# TileSpace Help & FAQ

Welcome to TileSpace! This guide covers the most common questions about capturing, organizing, and managing your digital workspace.

## Getting Started

### What is TileSpace?
TileSpace is a personal knowledge management tool designed for speed. It allows you to organize links and markdown notes into a visual grid of "Tiles" rather than buried folders.

### How do I create my first Tile?
Simply click on any empty slot in your grid. You can then give your tile a title, an emoji icon, and a specific color palette to help you identify it visually.

### What is the "Inbox" tile?
The Inbox is a special tile created automatically when you first capture a link via the keyboard shortcut. It acts as a "catch-all" for items you haven't sorted into specific tiles yet.

## Capture & Organization

### How do I use the Quick Capture shortcut?
You can quickly save links using **Cmd + K** (or **Ctrl + K**). If you are logged in, the link will be saved directly to your **Inbox** tile for later sorting.

### Can I move items between tiles?
Yes. You can drag and drop **Links** from one tile to another. You can also reorder the **Tiles** themselves by dragging them into different positions on the grid.

### How do many tiles can I have?
TileSpace uses a dynamic grid system:
- Up to 16 tiles: 4x4 grid
- 17 to 20 tiles: 5x4 grid
- 21 to 25 tiles: 5x5 grid
The maximum capacity is **25 tiles** per page.

## Navigation & UI

### How do I switch between pages?
There are three ways to navigate your pages:
1. Use the **Page Dots** bar at the bottom center.
2. Swipe left or right on a trackpad/mobile device.
3. Use your **Arrow Keys** on the keyboard.

### What is "Overview Mode"?
Overview Mode gives you a bird's-eye view of all your pages in a grid. You can enter it by clicking the **Disc** (the icon on the left of the page dots) or by tapping the background of the page dots bar.

### Why does the page title disappear?
To keep the interface clean, page titles only appear briefly when you switch pages. However, you can see the title at any time by **hovering your mouse** in the top-left corner.

## Notes & Documents

### How do I write a note?
Inside any tile, click "Add Note." This opens a full-screen Markdown editor. Your changes are auto-saved as you type.

### What happens if I close an empty note?
If you create a note but don't add any content, TileSpace will automatically delete it to keep your workspace clutter-free.

## Account & Security

### Is my data private?
Yes. TileSpace uses **Row Level Security (RLS)** via Supabase. This means your tiles and links are only accessible to you, even though they live in a shared database.

### How do I log out?
You can find the logout option in the **Floating Actions** menu (the three-dot or gear icon) located at the bottom-left of your screen.
